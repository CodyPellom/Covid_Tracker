    <h1>Confirmed Cases of Covid-19 in the United States</h1>
    <p>This site uses an API that tracks Covid-19 cases daily in the United States. While this information may
        be helpful in us tracking the virus, it is not accurate to the extent of tracking the cases that are not
        tracked. You can check this site daily to stay safer. Remember to avoid coming within 6 feet of the public.
